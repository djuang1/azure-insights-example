# Azure Application Insights in MuleSoft Anypoint Platform / CloudHub

Application Insights, a feature of Azure Monitor, is an extensible Application Performance Management (APM) service for developers. You can use it to monitor your live applications and it will automatically detect performance anomalies, and includes powerful analytics tools to help you diagnose issues and to understand what users actually do with your app.

Application Insights requires an agent to run side-by-side with your application and in our case, next to the Mule Runtime. This is easy for customers running on-premise, but what if a customer wants to run this in CloudHub.
